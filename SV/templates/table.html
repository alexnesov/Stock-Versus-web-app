  <h3>Patterns, patterns, patterns,...and proofs</h3>

  <hr>

</br>

  
  <blockquote style="text-align:center"><i>“History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.”</i>.
  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:center"><b>Mark Twain</b></p>

  <p>
    Many debates about the relevance of technical analysis (TA). <br>
      <br>
    One sure thing, there is a big difference between a guy pretending to be Nostradamus and a guy concluding that some aggregated behaviors are predictable. <br>
    As usual, the debate is polarized by the TA opponents, and as usual, things are more nuanced than what it seems first. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    If I place fire under your hand, you will move your hand. No crystal ball.
    If Kylie Jenner posts some Mascara on Instagram, it will sell more. No crystall ball used here either.
    The thing is to get the right signal at the right moment at the right place and to use reasonable </b>assumptions</b> first.
    Pattern thinking is both admired and despised.
    I personnaly had many discussions with highly educated people in the highest financial insitutions.
    Generally, people are reluctant to technical analysis. </br>
    But being very educated never prevented them to think before talking. They simply use words that sound more professional and
    reproduce the insitutional pattern they were thaught. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <b>1.</b> Don't ask financial advises from people who don't risk their own money, even if they work in finance.
    <br>

    <b>2.</b> And don't ask financial advise to people who risk their own money in such a way that they would avoid if they were risking other people's money. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Both these principles shouldn't be detached from one another.
    Majority of hedge funds get beaten by the market (they all have GMATS and come out of very pretistigous universities). The vast majority of retail traders loose money. 
  </br>
</br>
<b> Why do many fail? Because they often claim what <i>should be or not</i> from a mecanist point of view, instead of concluding <u>what could probably happen</u>.</b>
</br>
</br>
  We don't pay hedge funds and strategists to give us a moralistic point of view on the economy, i.e. to tell us what <b>"should"</b> be the price of an 
  asset or not. This is political economy.
  We pay them to predict. Usually, they come with moralistic point of views about what is the "right" price out of frustration after they failed to predict price surges 
  (and hence failed to enter in the bandwagon).
</br>
    
    Education never prevented them talking nosense (such as defending value investing in covid times or the market efficiency hypothesis).
    The absence of evidence echoes of course with discourses that sustain failure.
    This is because univerisites mainly teach hypothetico-deductive thinking, but without the elegance that a mathematican would have.
    And without remembering that the social world is not lead by the same rules as atoms and gravity.
  </br>
</br>

    In this mess, what is, or are, the remaining solution(s)?
    
    <li><b>Evidence based thinking.</b> It's simple as that. But it's difficult to apply. Requires work, people don't like to work, people prefer slogans over in depth analysis.</li>
    <li><b>Avoid what you learn in institutions.</b> Humans don't like to work, and hence they use institutional tools to think. As the processes are preconceived.
      
    </li>

</br>
    
    For Samuel P. Huntington, <b>Institutions</b> are: 
    <blockquote style="text-align:center"><i>"stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior"</i>.
    </blockquote>
What I said above particularly echoes to Huntington's sociological view of institutions. Incredible isn't it?
</br>
</br>
Institutions are our friends as they helps us yield profits (predictability). <br>
Institution is our ennemy as we shouldn't inherit from institutionnal thinking (inertia and defeat of critical mind). <br>

<br>


  </br>
</br>
 
  <b> In GTS, opinions and biases don't matter, only evidence does. When a guy asserts one thing, the next sentence should be argument(s) that prove the claim.</b>
  Preferably, figures.

  For now, only the stocks marked as signaled can be charted with the tool below.

<h4>ATR integration in the strategy</h4>
<hr>


<p>
  Average True Range denotes <b>>voltaility</b>, it doesn't denote trending. "Average" True Range is purely an exponential moving average of the true range.<br> 
<br>

Tje range of a day's trading is simply <i>high</i> - <i>low</i>. The <b>true range</b> extends it to yesterday's closing price
if it was outside of today's range.<br>
<br>
<img src="/static/TR.svg" alt="TR" class="center">

The <b>true range</b> is the largest of the:
<ul>
<li>Most recent period's high minus the most recent period's low</li>
<li>Absolute value of the most recent period's high minus the previous close</li>
<li>Absolute value of the most recent period's low minus the previous close</li>
</ul>
The ATR at the moment of time t is calculated using the following formula:

  <img src="/static/ATR.svg" alt="first_ATR" class="center">
  The first ATR value is calculated using the arithmetic mean formula:
